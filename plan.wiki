blogs should be divided into years, and each year should have an array of blogs
ordered by month, then ordered by day

the blog printer completes the entire archive logic;
it sends out an array of structs ::
  title string (is either a year or a blog)
  isYear bool (if true, page logic prints title as a header and skips filename)
  filename string (default empty, is what the page uses for href)
